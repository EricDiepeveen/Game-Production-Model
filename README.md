# Game Production Model

Welcome to the Game Production Model wiki.

The Game Production Model is a comprehensive framework designed to enhance the game production process and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of game producers.

## What is the Game Production Model?

The Game Production Model offers a structured approach to evaluate and assess the maturity level of game production processes within a game studio. It provides game producers a structured overview of all the functions of the game product management process. By leveraging this model, game producers gain a holistic view of the game development process, make informed decisions, and allocate resources effectively.

## What is this model not?

This model does not dive into the actual development activities of the game. It only provides an overview of the game production management aspects of the organization.


## Getting Started

As no studios are the same, not everything in this model is relevant to your organization. I encourage you to see this wiki as a starting point to develop your own model.

To dive deeper into the Game Production Model and explore its intricacies, please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/EricDiepeveen/gameproductionmodel/wiki). The wiki contains detailed information on each aspect of the model.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to further improve and expand the Game Production Model. If you have any suggestions, enhancements, or new insights to share, please feel free share your thoughts, criticisms, and ideas in the [discussions](https://github.com/EricDiepeveen/gameproductionmodel/discussions).

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to Willem Bekkers and Inge van de Weerd for their research on the "SPM Maturity Matrix", which heavily influenced the development of the Game Production Model.
